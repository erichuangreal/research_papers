        "Conceptual questions lack a realistically accessible ground-truth answer or widely accepted method for resolving them, but progress can be made by considering and debating arguments.",

        "Critiques are rated on centrality, strength, correctness, clarity, dead weight, single issue, and an overall holistic rating.",

        "The dataset contains 951 rated critiques.",

        "Reasoning or thinking generally does not improve performance much on the dataset; it sometimes helps and sometimes hurts, with differences usually being small.",

        "The paper uses a weighted pairwise ranking error rate and a custom weighted loss to evaluate model ratings.",

        # Paper 2
        "The four core AI safety properties are accuracy, bias, explainability, and accountability.",

        "Narrow AI performs a predefined task in a bounded input-output space with labelled examples and measurable correctness, so error rates and failure cases can be calculated.",

        "General-purpose AI can generate fluent and convincing explanations that may be post-hoc rationalizations rather than faithful representations of the processes that actually produced the output.",

        "Meaningfully checking a general-purpose AI analysis may require the human reviewer to independently perform the same analytical work. If the human can already do that, the AI may be redundant, while if they cannot, meaningful verification becomes difficult.",

        "The paper recommends distinguishing narrow AI from general-purpose AI in governance, preferring narrow tools when viable, pausing operational GPAI deployment in policing until sufficient evidence exists, and creating independent centralized safety infrastructure.",

        # Paper 3
        "The two asymmetries are capability profile and risk profile: mainstream AI demonstrates positive capabilities and optimizes average-case performance, while alignment must demonstrate the absence of hazardous behavior and address worst-case outcomes under fat-tailed uncertainty.",

        "The five gaps concern the optimization target, visibility or transparency of evidence, trustworthiness through verification and replication, treatment of uncertainty and unknowns, and enforcement culture or organized skepticism.",

        "ECAISA targets auditability rather than certification; it aims to make safety-relevant research claims independently inspectable, contestable, and verifiable rather than certify that an AI system is safe.",

        "The pilot found independent verification in zero percent of the ten alignment papers examined, with none citing an independent replication, third-party audit, or external red-team study of the central claim.",

        "The 10^-9 aviation failure rate is only an analogy because AI alignment lacks actuarial base-rate data, well-defined failure modes, and stationary system dynamics needed to justify such a numerical threshold; the intended lesson is evidence proportionality."
